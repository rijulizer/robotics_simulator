# experiments

1. Number of landmarks (Dima)
    1. Demonstrate what happens if 3 landmarks are visible to robot
    2. Demonstrate what happens if no landmarks are visible to robot

2. Modifying the filter (Tauseef)
    1. Experiment with noise estimates (see Kalman Filter Q and R)
    2. Experiment with quality of sensors (noise, systematic errors) - adding noise to belief
