# Mobile Robot
Autonomous Robotic System

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.11 

## Installation
### Explanation of Each Step:

1. **Cloning the Repository:** This command (`git clone`) makes a local copy of the repository on the user's machine.

2. **Install Required Libraries:** The `cd` command changes the directory to your project folder. The `pip install -r requirements.txt` command installs the Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file, which you should have in the same directory as your project files.
